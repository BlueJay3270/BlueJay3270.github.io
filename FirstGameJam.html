    This was my first "game", made in three hours. It was a text-based game because thet was what I
    knew how to make. My friend made a much more complicated game on unity but it was only playable on
    windows and I use ubuntu, a linux operating system so I couldn't try it. My game was the beter game
    simply because some of the people we asked to try the game couldn't play his.
  </p>

    For this game I used innerHTML to change the text of a div element on an HTML page. Useing this and
    some buttons I was able to make a chose your own advnture style text based game. My code was basicly
    many repititions of this:
  </p>
  <pre class='prettyprint'>
    if (location === 'some location') {
    document.getElementById(game).innerHTML = 'some text for this area'
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    By combinig this with an html page with some buttons a player could move around and interact with
    other things or people. The element with the ID 'game' was a div that contained some text explaining
    the game and giving the player a choice to make. When they clicked 'Yes' or 'No' it would trigger a
    line of if than statements that led to some new text for the player to decide what to do with. The
    project uses a few simple html tags an javascript logic makeing it a simple and easy project to do as
    a second or third webpage.
