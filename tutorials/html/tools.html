<div style='align: center;'><h1>Tools</h1></div>

Before you can start building a website you need some tools. The first tool you will need to have is a computer. Any will do, but don't
code on a phone or a tablet. Make sure your computer has a comfortable keyboard because you will be typing a lot. The second tool you
will need is a web brouser, which comes preinstalled on most computers. Again, any web brouser will do, I prefer firefox because the
included developer tools are easy to use. You will need to use the developer tool when running your code to find bugs so meke sure you
know how to open them now. (On firefox use ctrl + shift + i). Usuly the developer tools are in a menu at the top right corner of the
web brouser and have a hotkey to open them. The final tool you will need is a text editor. There is usuly a text editor already installed
on your compuer such an notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac os X). If you are on Linux it changes based on what flavor you chose but you
probably have one. These text editors all work but don't have as many of the speciall tools that you would get on a text editor made for
programing such as Atom. I have been useing Atom to program this website and most other projects I do because of the seamless Github
integraton and all the packages such as Teletype for sharing your code in real time with others. Alternitively you can use the text
editor included in this website. If you chose to use this method your code will not be saved but you will be able to see the example
code from each tutorial withount downloading it from each tutorial page. Also remember that the editor is still in beta and
has a few bugs.
